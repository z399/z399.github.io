    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>Mobile Verification Toolkit (MVT) is a collection of utilities designed to facilitate iOS and Android devices for the purpose of identifying any signs of compromise. MVT's capabilities are continuously evolving, but some of its key features include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Decrypt encrypted iOS backups.</li>
        <li>Process and parse records from numerous iOS system and apps databases, logs, and system analytics.</li>
        <li>Extract installed applications from Android devices.</li>
        <li>Extract diagnostic information from Android devices through the adb protocol.</li>
        <li>Compare extracted records to a provided list of malicious indicators in STIX2 format.</li>
        <li>Generate JSON logs of extracted records, and separate JSON logs of all detected malicious traces.</li>
        <li>Generate a unified chronological timeline of extracted records, along with a timeline all detected malicious traces.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="android-content"> Android devices provide much less observability than iOS . Android stores very little diagnostic information useful to triage potential compromises, and because of this, mvt-android capabilities are limited as well.</p>

    <h1>iOS Forensic Methodology</h1>

    <p>Before jumping into acquiring and analyzing data from an iOS device, you should evaluate what is your precise plan of action. Because multiple options are available to you, you should define and familiarize with the most effective forensic methodology in each case.</p>

    <h4>Filesystem Dump</h4>

    <p>You will need to decide whether to attempt to jailbreak the device and obtain a full filesystem dump, or not.</p>

    <p>While accessing the full filesystem allows extracting data that would otherwise be unavailable, it might not always be possible to jailbreak a certain iPhone model or version of iOS. In addition, depending on the type of jailbreak available, doing so might compromise some important records, pollute others, or potentially cause unintended malfunctioning of the device later in case it is used again.</p>

    <p>If you are not expected to return the phone, you might want to consider attempting a jailbreak after having exhausted all other options, including a backup.</p>

    <h4>iTunes Backup</h4>

    <p>An alternative option is to generate an iTunes backup (in most recent version of macOS, they are no longer launched from iTunes, but directly from Finder). While backups only provide a subset of the files stored on the device, in many cases it might be sufficient to at least detect some suspicious artifacts. Backups encrypted with a password will have some additional interesting records not available in unencrypted ones, such as Safari history, Safari state, etc.</p>


<h1>Installation</h1>

    <p>Before proceeding, please note that MVT requires Python 3.6+ to run. While it should be available on most operating systems, please make sure of that before proceeding.</p>

    <h2>Dependencies on Linux</h2>

    <p>First install some basic dependencies that will be necessary to build all required tools:</p>

    <pre><code>sudo apt install python3 python3-pip libusb-1.0-0 sqlite3</code></pre>

    <p><code>libusb-1.0-0</code> is not required if you intend to only use <code>mvt-ios</code> and not <code>mvt-android</code>.</p>

    <p>When working with Android devices you should additionally install <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools">Android SDK Platform Tools</a>. If you prefer to install a package made available by your distribution of choice, please make sure the version is recent to ensure compatibility with modern Android devices.</p>

    <h2>Dependencies on macOS</h2>

    <p>Running MVT on macOS requires Xcode and <a href="https://brew.sh">homebrew</a> to be installed.</p>

    <p>In order to install dependencies use:</p>

    <pre><code>brew install python3 libusb sqlite3</code></pre>

    <p><code>libusb</code> is not required if you intend to only use <code>mvt-ios</code> and not <code>mvt-android</code>.</p>

    <p>When working with Android devices you should additionally install <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools">Android SDK Platform Tools</a>:</p>

    <pre><code>brew install --cask android-platform-tools</code></pre>

    <p>Or by downloading the <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools">official binary releases</a>.</p>

    <h2>MVT on Windows</h2>

    <p>MVT does not currently officially support running natively on Windows. While most functionality should work out of the box, there are known issues especially with <code>mvt-android</code>.</p>

    <p>It is recommended to try installing and running MVT from <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about">Windows Subsystem Linux (WSL)</a> and follow Linux installation instructions for your distribution of choice.</p>

    <h2>Installing MVT</h2>

    <p>If you haven't done so, you can add this to your <code>.bashrc</code> or <code>.zshrc</code> file in order to add locally installed PyPI binaries to your <code>$PATH</code>:</p>

    <pre><code>export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin</code></pre>

    <p>Then you can install MVT directly from <a href="https://pypi.org/project/mvt/">PyPI</a>:</p>

    <pre><code>pip3 install mvt</code></pre>

    <p>If you want to have the latest features in development, you can install MVT directly from the source code. If you installed MVT previously from pypi, you should first uninstall it using <code>pip3 uninstall mvt</code> and then install from the source code:</p>

    <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/mvt-project/mvt.git
cd mvt
pip3 install .</code></pre>

    <p>You now should have the <code>mvt-ios</code> and <code>mvt-android</code> utilities installed.</p>

    <h1>Dumping the Filesystem</h1>

    <p>While iTunes backup provides a lot of very useful databases and diagnostic data, in some cases you might want to jailbreak the device and perform a full filesystem dump. In that case, you should take a look at <a href="https://checkra.in/">checkra1n</a>, which provides an easy way to obtain root on most recent iPhone models.</p>

    <div class="warning">
        <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Before you checkra1n any device, make sure you take a full backup, and that you are prepared to do a full factory reset before restoring it. Even after using checkra1n's "Restore System," some traces of the jailbreak are still left on the device and <a href="https://github.com/checkra1n/BugTracker/issues/279">apps with anti-jailbreaks will be able to detect them</a> and stop functioning.</p>
    </div>

    <p>After having jailbroken the device, you should be able to access the phone over ssh. In order to do this, you will typically need to use iproxy, which on Debian/Ubuntu systems can be installed with <code>libusbmuxd-tools</code>. Run the command:</p>

    <pre><code>iproxy 2222 44</code></pre>

    <p>Now you will be able to ssh as root to localhost on port 2222 and password <code>alpine</code>. Note: if you used a jailbreak other than checkra1n, you might need to specify a different port number instead of 44.</p>

    <p>At this point, you need to get access to the content of the device from your computer. One way is to run a command like <code>ssh root@localhost -p 2222 tar czf - /private > dump.tar.gz</code>, which will save a tarball on the host of the <code>/private/</code> folder from the phone. This will take a while.</p>

    <p>Alternatively, you can try to run <code>sftp-server</code> for iOS and mount the filesystem locally using <code>sshfs</code>.</p>

    <h2>Use <code>sshfs</code> on iOS</h2>

    <p>If you decide to try to use <code>sshfs</code>, you first have to download locally a compiled copy of sftp-server:</p>

    <pre><code>wget https://github.com/dweinstein/openssh-ios/releases/download/v7.5/sftp-server</code></pre>

    <p>Then upload the binary to the iPhone:</p>

    <pre><code>scp -P2222 sftp-server root@localhost:.</code></pre>

    <p>You will need to ssh into the device and set some entitlements to allow <code>sftp-server</code> to run. These entitlements can be copied from an existing binary:</p>

    <pre><code>chmod +x sftp-server
ldid -e /binpack/bin/sh > /tmp/sh-ents
ldid -S /tmp/sh-ents sftp-server</code></pre>

    <p>Now you can create a folder on the host and use it as a mount point (<strong>note:</strong> do not create this folder in <code>/tmp/</code>):</p>

    <pre><code>mkdir root_mount
sshfs -p 2222 -o sftp_server=/var/root/sftp-server root@localhost:/ root_mount</code></pre>

    <h1>Check a Filesystem Dump with <code>mvt-ios</code></h1>

    <p>When you are ready, you can proceed running <code>mvt-ios</code> against the filesystem dump or mount point:</p>

    <pre><code>$ mvt-ios check-fs --help
Usage: mvt-ios check-fs [OPTIONS] DUMP_PATH

  Extract artifacts from a full filesystem dump

Options:
  -i, --iocs PATH     Path to indicators file
  -o, --output PATH   Specify a path to a folder where you want to store JSON
                      results

  -f, --fast          Avoid running time/resource consuming features
  -l, --list-modules  Print list of available modules and exit
  -m, --module TEXT   Name of a single module you would like to run instead of
                      all

  --help              Show this message and exit.</code></pre>

    <p>Following is an example of basic usage of <code>check-fs</code>:</p>

    <pre><code>mvt-ios check-fs /path/to/filesystem/dump/ --output /path/to/output/</code></pre>

    <p>This command will create a few JSON files containing the results from the extraction. If you do not specify a <code>--output</code> option, <code>mvt-ios</code> will just process the data without storing results on disk.</p>

    <p>Through the <code>--iocs</code> argument, you can specify a <a href="https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/intro">STIX2</a> file defining a list of malicious indicators to check against the records extracted from the backup by <code>mvt</code>. Any matches will be highlighted in the terminal output as well as saved in the output folder using a "<em>*_detected*</em>" suffix to the JSON file name.</p>
